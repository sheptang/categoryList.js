Nested Checkbox Manager
=======================

# categoryList.js

categoryList.js is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin which manages the checkboxes' "checked" or "unchecked" status according to their hierarchy. If any checkbox in the nest is clicked, the function either checks or unchecks other related checkboxes.
