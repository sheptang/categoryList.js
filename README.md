# categoryList.js

categoryList.js is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin which manages the checkboxes' "checked" or "unchecked" status according to their hierarchy. If any checkbox in the nest is clicked, the function either checks or unchecks other related checkboxes.

Documentation
-------------

checkboxClick function can be implemented to every `checkbox` type `input` element by adding

	onclick="checkboxClick(this.id)"

Demo
----

[Demo view](http://sheptang.com/software/categoryList/) is still under construction.

Installation
------------

- `categoryList.js` or `categoryList.min.js` file should be included
- jQuery should be included
- `onclick="checkboxClick(this.id)"` should be implemented to every `checkbox` type `input` element.

As soon as there is no change in class names and function names, the module should work right away.
